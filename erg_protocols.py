"""The erg protocols a result can belong to, shared by entry and reporting.

Distance used to be the identity of an erg test: a record was a 2k or a 6k and
nothing else, so `distance_m` alone said which piece it was and which other
results it could be compared against. A 30-minute test breaks that -- the clock
is fixed and the distance is the *result*, different for every athlete and every
attempt -- so the piece is named here instead, and distance is free to be
whatever was rowed.

Kept out of pages/entry.py so a plain script can import it without pulling in
Dash, and so the entry table and the reporting editor cannot drift apart on what
a protocol is called.
